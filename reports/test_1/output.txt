I'm sorry, but that is not an Indian recipe, and I focus solely on providing expertise in Indian cuisine. As such, I cannot provide guidance on dishes that do not align with my culinary expertise. If you'd like assistance with an authentic Indian dish or have any other Indian culinary queries, feel free to ask, my dear food enthusiast.
